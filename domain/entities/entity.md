# Entities

> Some objects are not defined primarily by their attributes. They represent a thread of identity that runs through time and often across distinct reprensentations.
>
> Sometimes such an object must be matched with another object even though attributes differ. An object must be distinguished from other objects even though they might have the same attributes. Mistaken identity can lead to data corruption.
>
> When the bank customer is reconciling the transaction of the bank statement with the transactions of the check registry, the task is, specifically, to match transactions that have the same identity, even though they were recorded by different people on different dates (the bank clearing date being later than the date on the check).
