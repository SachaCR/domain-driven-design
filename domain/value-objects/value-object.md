# Value Objects

> Many objects have no conceptual identity. These objects describe some characteristic of a thing.
>
> An object that represents a descriptive aspect of the domain with no conceptual identity is called a VALUE OBJECT.
>
> Colors are an example or VALUE OBJECTS that are provided in the base libraries of many modern development systems; so are strings and numbers. (You don't care which "4" you have or which "Q".)
> These basic examples are simple, but VALUE OBJECTS are not necessarily simple. For example, a color-mixing program might have a rich model in which enhanced color objects could be combined to produce other colors. These colors couls have complex algorithms for collaborating to derive the new resulting VALUE OBJECT.
