# Repositories

> Provide methods to add and remove objects, which will encapsulate the actual insertion or removal of data in the datastore.
>
> Provide methods that select objects based on some criteria and return fully instantiated objects or collections of objects whose attribute values meet the criteria, thereby encapsulating the actual storage and query technology.
>
> Provide REPOSITORIES only for AGGREGATE roots that actually need direct access. Keep the client focused on the model delegating all obkect sotrage and access to the REPOSITORIES
