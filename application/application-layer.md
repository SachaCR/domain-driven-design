# Application layer

> Define the jobs the software is supposed to do and directs the expressive >domain object to work out problems.
>
> The tasks this layer is reponsible for are meaningful to the business or >necessary for interactions with the application layers of other systems.
>
> This layer is kept thin. It does not contain business rules or knowledge, >but only coordinates tasks and delegates work to collaborations of domain >objects in the next layer down. It does not have state reflecting the >business situation, but it can have state that reflects the progress of a >task for the user or the program.
